# Project BETH: Negentropy Finance Model
## Economic Stability Logic
Project BETH utilizes a proprietary currency stabilization engine to reduce financial "noise" (Entropy) and maximize capital efficiency (Negentropy).

### Core Pillars:
* **Liquidity Sovereignty:** Decentralized reserves for currency backing.
* **Low-Latency Settlement:** High-speed tech stack for instant transactions.
* **Value Retention:** Automated burn/mint cycles based on market volatility.
